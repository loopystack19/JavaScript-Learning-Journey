**Variables**-Variables are containers in memory space that store values, they behave like the value they contain

**Variable declaration in Javascript**

in javascript we can declare a variable using a few keywords:

**1.Let**-let is blocked scope meaning that its confined to the nearest {} block

**Sample programme**

let age=25;

console.log(`Am {age} years old`);

**2.Var**-when declared inside a function its has a local scope but when declared outside a function its has a global scope

**sample programme**

var name="Jafar Hussein";

console.log(`His name is ${name}`);
